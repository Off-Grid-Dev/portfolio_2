## Project Overview

Semester Project 2 is a full-stack React application built for Noroffâ€™s curriculum, designed as a social platform for dog enthusiasts. Users can browse profiles, view details about individual dogs, and interact within a modern, responsive interface.

### Key Features

- Dynamic routing using React Router.
- Modular React components for pages and layouts.
- Data fetching via custom hooks, with error boundaries and suspense for robust UX.
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile.

### Portfolio Enhancements

- **React Upgrade:** Refactored all routing and components to use React, replacing vanilla TypeScript logic for scalability and maintainability.
- **Advanced Hooks:** Added custom `use()` fetch hook, ErrorBoundary, and Suspense for improved data handling and error recovery.
- **UI/Accessibility:** Improved structure and accessibility throughout the app.

#### Intentional Upgrades (Checklist)

```md
- Installed React and set up routing
- Updated pages/components to React
- Implemented custom hooks (`use()`), ErrorBoundary, and Suspense
```

### Example Code Improvements

**Routing (before/after):**

- Manually managed routing replaced with declarative React Router configuration for cleaner navigation and code structure.

**Component Upgrades:**

- Pages such as Dogs now use hooks and suspense for data fetching, with error handling built in.
